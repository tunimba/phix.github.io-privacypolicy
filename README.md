# Phix – Privacy Policy
Last updated: [08.06.2025]

# 1. Introduction
Phix (“Phix,” “we,” “our”) is a mobile application that restores, colourises, and enhances photographs with AI-powered image processing. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, how we keep it safe, and which rights you have. By using Phix, you accept the practices described here.

# 2. Data We Collect
User-provided content – Photographs you upload or capture in the app

Purchase and credit information – Apple in-app-purchase receipt data (transaction ID, product identifier, price, currency, time stamp) and your current credit balance.

Usage and diagnostic information – In-app actions such as button taps and screen visits, crash logs, performance metrics, locale, and time zone.

# 3. How We Process Your Photos
On-device pre-processing – Basic orientation fixes or resizing may occur directly on your device.
Secure upload – Images are transmitted to our servers through encrypted TLS connections.
Cloud processing – AI models perform restoration or colourisation in an automated pipeline; human review happens only if you explicitly ask for manual quality assistance.
Temporary storage – Raw uploads and generated outputs are stored in encrypted form and deleted automatically.
Result delivery – Finished images are returned to your device, after which they can be saved locally or shared. They are then purged from active servers and backups on the same schedule.

# 4. Third-Party Services
• Apple In-App Purchase / App Store (payment processing and licence validation)
• A cloud AI provider (for example, Replicate) that supplies GPU infrastructure for image processing
• Firebase Crashlytics (optional crash reporting)

Each provider may use data only to deliver the requested service and must follow strict confidentiality and security obligations.

# 5. How We Use Your Information
We use your data to: operate and improve Phix; complete purchases and manage credit balances; process and deliver restored photos; detect and prevent fraud or misuse; diagnose crashes and performance issues; answer support requests; and—only with your consent—send you feature updates, tips, or promotions.

# 6. Data Retention
• Photos and generated images: kept no longer after processing.
• Purchase and credit records
• Crash and analytics logs
• Support correspondence

# 7. Security Measures
No employee can view your photos unless you specifically request help.

# 8. Children’s Privacy
Phix is not intended for children under 4 (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have done so inadvertently, contact us so we can delete the information.

# 9. International Transfers
Our servers and service providers may be located outside your country. When data is transferred internationally, we rely on approved mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses and implement additional safeguards to ensure adequate protection.

# 10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in technology, law, or business practice. The “Last updated” date shows the latest revision.
