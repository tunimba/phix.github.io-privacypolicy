# Phix – Privacy Policy
Last updated: [DD Month YYYY]

# 1. Introduction
Phix (“Phix,” “we,” “our”) is a mobile application that restores, colourises, and enhances photographs with AI-powered image processing. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, how we keep it safe, and which rights you have. By using Phix, you accept the practices described here.

# 2. Data We Collect
User-provided content – Photographs you upload or capture in the app, plus any optional captions, project names, or notes you attach.

Purchase and credit information – Apple in-app-purchase receipt data (transaction ID, product identifier, price, currency, time stamp) and your current credit balance.

Usage and diagnostic information – In-app actions such as button taps and screen visits, crash logs, performance metrics, device model, operating-system version, locale, and time zone.

Optional contact information – Your e-mail address or social-media handle when you reach out to our support team or join beta programmes.

# 3. How We Process Your Photos
On-device pre-processing – Basic orientation fixes or resizing may occur directly on your device.
Secure upload – Images are transmitted to our servers through encrypted TLS connections.
Cloud processing – AI models perform restoration or colourisation in an automated pipeline; human review happens only if you explicitly ask for manual quality assistance.
Temporary storage – Raw uploads and generated outputs are stored in encrypted form and deleted automatically within 72 hours (or sooner if you delete them yourself).
Result delivery – Finished images are returned to your device, after which they can be saved locally or shared. They are then purged from active servers and backups on the same schedule.

# 4. Third-Party Services
• Apple In-App Purchase / App Store (payment processing and licence validation)
• A cloud AI provider (for example, Replicate) that supplies GPU infrastructure for image processing
• Firebase Crashlytics (optional crash reporting)

Each provider may use data only to deliver the requested service and must follow strict confidentiality and security obligations.

# 5. How We Use Your Information
We use your data to: operate and improve Phix; complete purchases and manage credit balances; process and deliver restored photos; detect and prevent fraud or misuse; diagnose crashes and performance issues; answer support requests; and—only with your consent—send you feature updates, tips, or promotions.

# 6. Data Retention
• Photos and generated images: kept no longer than 72 hours after processing.
• Purchase and credit records: stored for up to ten years to comply with tax and accounting law.
• Crash and analytics logs: stored for up to 24 months before aggregation or deletion.
• Support correspondence: retained for three years after the ticket is closed.

# 7. Security Measures
We safeguard data with end-to-end TLS encryption in transit, AES-256 encryption at rest, role-based access controls, periodic penetration tests, and the principle of least privilege for staff. No employee can view your photos unless you specifically request help.

# 8. Your Rights
Depending on your region, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or transfer your personal data; to restrict or object to certain processing; and to withdraw consent for marketing or model-improvement programmes. You can exercise most of these rights in the app’s Settings → Privacy menu or by contacting us (Section 12).

# 9. Children’s Privacy
Phix is not intended for children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have done so inadvertently, contact us so we can delete the information.

# 10. International Transfers
Our servers and service providers may be located outside your country. When data is transferred internationally, we rely on approved mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses and implement additional safeguards to ensure adequate protection.

# 11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in technology, law, or business practice. Material changes will be announced in the app or via e-mail (if we have your address) at least seven days before they take effect. The “Last updated” date shows the latest revision.

Thank you for trusting Phix with your memories. We are committed to keeping them private and secure.
